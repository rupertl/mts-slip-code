0Contents:      A library of FORTRAN-callable subroutines.
0Purpose:       To  provide  list-processing   capabilities   for
                FORTRAN users.
0Location:      UNSP:LSLIPLIB
0Use:           The file is concatenated to the object modules of
                the calling program on the $RUN command, e.g.,
0                         $RUN object+UNSP:LSLIPLIB
0Description:   LSLIP  (Little  Symmetric  List  Processor)  is a
                version of SLIP that uses single precision rather
                than double precision real numbers.   A  complete
                description  of the SLIP language may be found in
                the Communications of  the  ACM,  Vol. 6,  No. 9,
+                   ______________ __  ___  ___
                September, 1963, pp. 524-544.  SLIP is documented
                in MTS Volume 8.
